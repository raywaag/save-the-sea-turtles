      I entered graduate school in zoology without really knowing what area in that enormous field was of greatest interest. 
      I did know that spending time around marine habitats, be they marshes, bays or the open ocean, was where I was happiest,
      especially when observing the amazing activities of their inhabitants. All that uncertainty disappeared two weeks after 
      I enrolled in an Animal Behavior class taught by the professor who ultimately guided my studies toward an advanced degree.
      His class was an introduction to the entire field and covered a wide range of topics in two general areas: (i) what we 
      knew (at the time) about what animals did and why they did it, and (ii) how to design proper experiments to find out more. I was soon totally “hooked”!

          Those aspects sometimes included information that we can’t detect, such as the earth’s magnetic field or high-frequency 
          “ultrasound”. Collectively, those discoveries led to the realization that how we view the world is unique to us, but not 
          a “better” version than one possessed by another species. The common denominator is that each complement of sense organs 
          provides a perceptual “window” into the external world. That window is modified through evolution to detect what each 
          species needs to know. A proper understanding of that perceptual world requires knowing not only where each species lives 
          (on land or under water). Those differences were caused by 
          the unique properties of their sense organs (eyes, ears, touch, smell, etc.) used to inform them about their environment.

          30 m while leatherbacks feed on jellyfishes and other “gelatinous” creatures in open water, sometimes near the surface but often 
          at depths that can exceed hundreds of meters. Since all marine turtles must spend some time near the surface (to breathe), one 
          might expect that they should detect much of the broad spectrum of light wavelengths present there. But to the extent that they 
          spend even more time in deeper water they need to be especially sensitive to the light wavelengths present there since those best 
          reveal the location of food, shelter, mates, and sources of danger such as predators. Is that what they do?

          On the other hand, there is a relatively simple and easily understood relationship between the concentration of 
          these analyzers on the retinal surface and the visual ecology of animals living in different places. Animals found 
          in open areas with a clear view of the horizon are most interested in visual events that take place on that horizon 
          (for example, the approach of a predator). For that reason, they concentrate their retinal analyzers in a narrow, 
          horizontal “visual streak” that parallels that location (Figure 5). On the other hand, there is a 
          relatively simple and easily understood relationship between the concentration of 
          these analyzers on the retinal surface and the visual ecology of animals living in different places. 
          Visual streaks are less prominent among animals 
          that must maneuver through or around obstacles, such as trees in a forest or reefs under water. On the other hand, 
          predators that detect discrete targets often concentrate their retinal analyzers in circular spots called “areas”. 
          These areas are appropriately placed in the retina to register the location of those targets in space.For that reason, 
          they concentrate their retinal analyzers in a narrow,  horizontal “visual streak” that parallels that location (Figure 5).

          One of our students (2) took on the very laborious task of identifying the concentration of those retinal analyzers 
          in hatchling green turtles, loggerheads and leatherbacks. (These were all turtles that had recently died inside the 
          nest so none were sacrificed.) The results were quite interesting! Green turtles and loggerheads had visual streaks 
          but those streaks were especially narrow in green turtles (Figure 6) that feed in open seagrass meadows (Figure 5). 
          The retinas of leatherback hatchlings contained both a visual streak and an area, with the latter located in the 
          upper half of the retina toward the rear of its concavity. That area would focus on targets located in the opposite 
          direction, that is, ahead and below the turtle. Leatherbacks sometimes hunt for jellyfish while swimming near the 
          surface. When they see one beneath and ahead of them, they dive down to consume it (Figure 7). That’s why our student 
          called the leatherback area a “jellyfish detector”.

            Do Sea Turtle have Color Vision?
          </h3>
          <p style="padding:0;">
              Color vision is characteristic of many, but not all, day-active animals. It plays an important role in recognizing 
              mates, in finding suitable food, and in detecting enemies. Because color vision requires a lot of additional neural 
              machinery, it doesn’t always evolve because there is another, simpler presented with a pair of colored targets, one of 
              which had been previously rewarded. That took only a few days. Finally, and in the crucial test, each turtle had to 
              choose the correct target from a pair when each target’s brightness varied from one trial to the next. All the turtles 
              passed that test almost immediately, showing conclusively that targets were distinguished by their color. Bravo! Sea 
              turtles have color vision!
