          How you can make a difference
        </h3>
        <p style="padding:0;">
          Your generous support will help us fight an uphill battle to solve the
          problems at hand but will also support our future goals, to educate,
          conserve, and protect today so our children and theirs can enjoy the
          planets oceans and waterways and its habitats that we enjoy today. We
          hope that you will help and be long remembered giving future
          generations the opportunity to enjoy the wonders of our earth and
          oceans.
          <br /><br />
          Would you like to leave a long-lasting legacy to protect sea turtles
          and marine life? Would you like to conserve and protect the planet’s
          oceans and waterways today so our children and their children can
          enjoy them tomorrow? Education is the key to passing on the knowledge
          needed for future generations to continue to protect our natural
          resources.
          <br /><br />
          In order to give scholars, professors, and teachers the opportunity to
          pass on their knowledge, your Estate Planning can support a student’s
          education through the Elite Sea Turtle Society Scholarship Program.
          You can make a real difference in a young person’s life by helping
          provide the means for them to earn a graduate degree. These graduates
          can then continue to carry the banner of marine education, protection,
          public awareness, and research for the students of tomorrow.
          <br /><br />
          Our continued success in protecting marine life relies on the
          foresight of people like yourself who plan ahead. It’s simple, and
          something to take into consideration with your Estate Planning.
          Examples are making the Foundation a beneficiary of a life insurance
          policy or portion thereof. Other options include retirement plans,
          brokerage accounts, and/or annual contributions with certificates of
          deposit. Most of us have a will or trust, and you may want to consult
          with your attorney, accountant, or financial executive to discuss the
          potential tax benefits of contributing to the National Save The Sea
          Turtle Foundation, and to guarantee that your wishes will be carried
          out.
          <br /><br />
          With your planned gift to NSTSTF you will become a member of the Elite
          Sea Turtle Society. Your gift will help us continue to support our
          education, protection, and public awareness programs, our own ongoing
          Hawksbill Sea Turtle Research Program, and help expand our efforts to
          support the scientists of tomorrow. Thank you!
          <br /><br />
          If you would like to take this opportunity to join today your tax
          deductible contribution of $5000.00 will ensure your membership now.

          Florida Atlantic University Undergraduate Scholarship Program
        </h3>
        <p style="padding:0;">
          The National Save The Sea Turtle Foundation plans to donate sufficient
          funds to Florida Atlantic University for 4 undergraduate scholarships
          at $15,000 each during the 2018-2019 academic year. The scholarship
          will provide financial assistance to Charles E. Schmidt College of
          Science seniors enrolled at the Boca Raton Campus who demonstrate
          academic excellence, financial need, and a commitment to become
          scholars and ambassadors that represent the Marine Science program at
          Florida Atlantic University. As such, they are expected to develop as
          well-rounded, skilled, and committed individuals who are motivated to
          engage the public through education, research and outreach activities
          appropriate to both their specific interests in the field, as well as
          those of importance in the field of marine biology.
          <br /><br />
          The ideal candidate is an undergraduate about to enter their senior
          year with interest in any aspect of marine biology research at the
          ecological, evolutionary, or behavioral level and educational
          outreach. Preference will be given to applicants in good standing in
          the biology department’s Honors Thesis Program who demonstrate
          financial need, coupled with a commitment to community service,

          2017 National Save-The-Sea-Turtle Foundation Graduate Scholarships at
          Florida Atlantic University
        </h3>
        <p style="padding:0;">
          The National Save The Sea Turtle Foundation has again funded generous
          scholarships for graduate students in the Department of Biological
          Sciences at Florida Atlantic University. An increase in the dollar
          amount this year enabling the department to provide support to 8
          talented, hard-working students who are making substantial progress
          toward completing advanced (Masters, Doctoral) degrees. Their research
          projects have in common that they deal with central topics in marine
          biology: how animals are functionally designed, how they exploit and
          perceive their environment, how they interact with one another, and
          how they are affected by human-induced environmental change.
          <br /><br />
          It’s no accident that the organisms selected for these studies are
          “charismatic megafauna” – large, magnificent creatures that have
          persisted on earth for millions of years, play a dominant role in
          marine ecosystems, and have captured the interest and attention of
          humans throughout our history. They are unfortunately also organisms
          whose numbers have been severely depleted, thanks to our increasingly
          efficient ability to harvest them and to degrade the habitats they
          require to replace their numbers. These are, specifically, the marine
          turtles and the cartilaginous fishes (sharks, skates, rays).

          National Save-the-Sea Turtle Foundation awards four $1000 Graduate
          Scholarships to Florida Atlantic University
        </h3>
        <p style="padding:0;">
          The Department of Biological Sciences has once again been the
          recipient of five scholarships, totaling $4000, from the National
          Save-the-Sea-Turtle Foundation of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. These
          funds are used to support graduate research at the Master of Science
          and Doctoral levels. While in the past the Foundation has provided
          funding for projects involving marine turtles, this year the decision
          was made to support broader topics of research dealing with the
          conservation, management, or basic biology of marine fishes as well as
          turtles. This topical expansion also better reflects the interests of
          our department which in recent years, has expanded by hiring of
          several new and outstanding faculty in the various subdisciplines of
          marine biology. Their students can now apply and compete for these
          important scholarships. Below, I summarize their projects.
          <br /><br />
          Sharks have very unique skin properties, compared to other animals. It
          has been shown to contribute to shark swimming by acting as an
          external tendon that transmits forces along the animal’s body. The
          skin is covered in small teeth-like structures called dermal
          denticles. Denticle shape and size varies among species and along the
          length of the body. Previous studies on shark skin mechanics have been
          only been done on one species, so Shelby is interested in determining
          the mechanical properties of shark skin among several species,
          selected because of differences in how they swim. She will also
          examine regional differences in skin properties at twelve different
          locations on the shark’s body. Skin from the blacktip, the scalloped
          hammerhead, and the shortfin mako sharks will be stretched using a
          materials testing system until skin failure is reached. That’s the
          point at which the skin breaks. This system is similar to what an
          engineer use to test the properties of concrete or steel. For this
          study, she is calculating ultimate skin strength (force required to
          break the skin), stiffness (the skin’s ability to resist tension), as
          well as the size and number of denticles per mm2 for each sample.
          Denticle information will be correlated with ultimate strength and
          stiffness.
          <br /><br />
          Mechanical testing may be of great interest to engineers, but why
          would this be important biologically? These findings will detail the
          mechanical properties and denticle shape and size from several
          species, and may provide inspiration for the development of new types
          of flexible propulsion systems and biologically inspired materials for
          construction.

          Inwater Research Group Provides Unique Sea Turtle Education Program
        </h3>
        <p style="padding:0;">
          In 2016, IRG was able to make amazing strides in the field of
          conservation education. We wrapped up our Treasured Turtles: Treasure
          Coast Sea Turtle Outreach Program for At-risk Youth. This program
          allowed us to find the most severely undeserved schools in our
          surrounding school districts and offer them free in-class programs.
          Students were able to get hands-on with real artifacts and step into
          the role of biologists as they assessed and collected data from their
          very own model turtle. We visited four school districts, taught myriad
          of grade levels, and reached nearly 1,500 students. In addition to
          this grant program, we continued to visit schools by request in
          surrounding school districts. Engaging in-class presentations and
          demonstrations were delivered to over 500 students. Along with our
          Treasured Turtles grants program, we were able to reach over 2,000
          students from 55 classrooms giving over 78 presentations.

            <p>
              Our Traveling Turtles: Traveling Trunk Program is a hands-on,
              experiential way for students to feel what it’s like to practice
              real science. Our traveling trunks are available to local
              teachers, who may run its 4-lesson module for up to three weeks in
              their classrooms. Kits include artifacts, biological tools, model
              turtles, interactive videos, and a ready-made lesson binder.
              Teachers and district coordinators laud its inquiry-based nature
              and its free status. Students are engaged with the STEM (science,
              technology, engineering, and math) content and enjoy the feeling
              of being a marine biologist as they run through the same data
              collection marine biologists do on a daily basis.
              <br /><br />
              In 2015, the program was in such high demand that our two trunks
              could not accommodate all requests. Because of this, we launched
              two more trunks, totaling four to reach as many students locally
              as we could. Within two months, the program booked once again to
              capacity and this year we are slated to reach over 10,000 students
              in Martin and St.Lucie County School Districts.
